OpenVPN 3 is a C++ class library that implements the functionality of an OpenVPN client, and is protocol-compatible with the OpenVPN 2.x branch.

OpenVPN 3 includes a minimal client wrapper (cli) that links in with the library and provides basic command line functionality.

OpenVPN 3 is currently used in production as the core of the OpenVPN Connect clients for iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

NOTE: As of 2017, OpenVPN 3 is primarily of interest to developers, as it does not yet replicate the full functionality of OpenVPN 2.x. In particular, server functionality is not yet implemented.
